## Cloudflare Pages Deployment Notes
 
If you get:
 
```
Error: Missing Cloudflare BLOB binding (R2)
```

Make sure your R2 binding name is:

```
BLOB
```

and not:

```
hubBlob
```

Example:

```
Type: R2 Bucket
Binding name: BLOB
Bucket: your-bucket-name
```

This gallery reads images directly from R2 using NuxtHub Blob. Images uploaded from either the website or the Cloudflare R2 dashboard will appear immediately without rebuilding or redeploying.
